# Bowling-Game

##Overview:
This project aims to create a realistic and interactive bowling game using C++. The game provides players with an immersive experience, allowing them to enjoy the thrill of bowling right from their computers. With intuitive controls and dynamic gameplay, the C++ Bowling Game brings the excitement of the bowling alley to the digital realm.

## Features:

Interactive Interfaces: The game features various interfaces including a home screen, instructional modules, and a dynamic playing arena. These interfaces enhance user experience and guide players through the game.

Realistic Gameplay Mechanics: Users can control the ball's position, select the direction, and adjust the speed before rolling it towards the pins. The gameplay mechanics closely mimic real-life bowling, providing players with an authentic experience.

Player Engagement: Each player is granted three frames, and within each frame, they have two attempts to knock over the pins. Points are allocated based on the number of pins knocked over, adding a competitive element to the game and keeping players engaged throughout.

Customization Options: Players can personalize their gaming experience by adjusting the ball's position, selecting different directions, and varying the speed of the roll. This level of customization allows players to tailor the game to their preferences and skill level.

## Technical Details:

#### Language: The game is developed entirely in C++, leveraging its power and flexibility to create a robust gaming experience.
#### Object-Oriented Design: The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles to organize code and facilitate scalability and maintenance.
#### Graphics and User Interface: The game employs graphical elements and user-friendly interfaces to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.
#### Modular Architecture: The codebase is structured in a modular fashion, making it easy to extend functionality and add new features in the future.
